// Package playscan checks an Android project against Google Play's Developer
// Program Policies and its published distribution deadlines.
//
// Everything here is static: it reads AndroidManifest.xml and the Gradle build
// files that ship in the repo. That is deliberate — the scan runs offline with
// no Play Console credentials — but it also bounds what the scan can see. The
// manifest in source is the *pre-merge* manifest, so permissions contributed by
// library manifests are invisible until the merge runs at build time. Findings
// here are therefore sound but not complete: what it reports is real, and a
// clean scan is not proof of a clean merged manifest. APK/AAB inspection reads
// the merged result and closes that gap.
